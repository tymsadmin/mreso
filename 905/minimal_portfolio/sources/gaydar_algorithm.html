            <h1>Deep Learning to Predict Sexual Orientation in Public Space
                <span class="status-tag published">Published</span>
            </h1>
            
            
            <p>In September 2017, an algorithm claiming to predict people's sexual orientation sparked intense debate about predictive machines and the role of social sciences in addressing such technologies. This research, led by Stanford psychology professor Michal Kosinski, raises critical questions beyond mere ethical considerations.</p>
            
            <p>The study makes three controversial claims: a return to physiognomy in the deep learning era, performance explained through a "biologizing" theory of sexual orientation origins, and predictions about the end of privacy. Our analysis examines the relevance of Kosinski's alert within the broader controversy surrounding predictive algorithms entering public discourse.</p>
            
            <p>This article highlights the ambiguity of the "whistleblower" status explicitly assumed by the authors. Critical examination of their predictive model reveals fundamental flaws: inability to demonstrate prenatal hormonal origins of sexual orientation and failure to distinguish sexual orientations of individuals in public spaces.</p>
            
            <p>The research exposes how machine learning algorithms, despite their technical sophistication, can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and pseudoscientific theories when applied to complex social phenomena without proper theoretical grounding.</p>
